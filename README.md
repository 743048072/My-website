## About me 

I just graduated with a **master of science degree** majoring in **Business Analytics** at Bentley University. My courses have helped me develop my **statistical, model building, and programming** skills. Through many simulated projects, I was able to manipulate data by performing quantitative analysis using statistical software such as **Python, R and SQL** and visualize my results using **Tableau**. 

I held a **research assistant** position at Bentley Research Network department, working on **data analytics** for the Non-profit organization, Pine Street Inn, where I processed data and offered strategic support for solutions to different types of **homelessness**.
