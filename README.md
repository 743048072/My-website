# About me 

I just graduated with a  `master of science degree`  majoring in  `Business Analytics`  at Bentley University. My courses have helped me develop my `statistical, model building, and programming` skills. Through many simulated projects, I was able to manipulate data by performing quantitative analysis using statistical software such as `Python, R and SQL` and visualize my results using `Tableau`. 

I held a `research assistant` position at Bentley Research Network department, working on `data analytics` for the Non-profit organization, Pine Street Inn, where I processed data and offered strategic support for solutions to different types of `homelessness`
