# About me 

I just graduated with a master of science degree majoring in Business Analytics at Bentley University. My courses have helped me develop my statistical, model building, and programming skills. Through many simulated projects, I was able to manipulate data by building robust models and performing quantitative analysis using statistical software such as R, Python, and SQL. I held a research assistant position at Bentley Research Network department, working on data analytics for the Non-profit organization, Pine Street Inn, where I processed data and offered strategic support for solutions to different types of homelessness.
